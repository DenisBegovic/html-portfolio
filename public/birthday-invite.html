<h1>I'm coming BACK!!!</h1>

<h3>Here, here, important NEEEWS</h3>
<p>
    I thought long and hard if should come back to that hellhole. 
    <br/>Lake Placid, a place many bad nights and a few good ones.
    <br/>In the end, I was basicaly peer-pressured into coming back, even though I think it'll be the same.
    <br/>At least I will come back with more than twice as much money as before.
    <br/>But I'm coming back. I know, I know. You are happy, and frankly you should be C:
    <br/>
    <br/>It might as well be your birthday, here's your cake.

<h3>Reasons why I'm coming back:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The people
        <ul>
            <li>There are many bad apples in the apple basket, <br/>but there is a chance a few good ones will roll to my feet.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>To escape
        <ul>
            <li>I really don't know what I would do in Sarajevo, being that I don't have a stable friend group.
                <br/>I'd rather be working 14 hours a day and be exhausted then feel lonely.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>The money</li>

    <li>Nothing better to do</li>
</ul>
