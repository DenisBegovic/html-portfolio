        <h4>La La Land</h4>
        <p>I don't really have a lot to say about it. <br/>
            I don't really care about perfomances and all of that,<br/>
             but the movie packs an emotional punch like nothing I've ever watched before. <br/>
             I think I'm just the kind of guy that type of movie will effect.
             <h3>8/10</h3>

        <h4>Pulp Fiction</h4>
        <p> 
            I don't really remember what the movei is about, but I do remember that it was chill and movies should be.<br/>
            Tarantino doesn't force feed you characters. They are there for you to like or dislike. Like real life.<br/>
            The movie doesn't make it obvious what my feelings on the movie should be. And I REALLY like that.<br/>
            And this dance...<br/><br/><img src="../assets/images/dance-pulp-fiction.gif"/>

        <h4>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h4>
        <p>
            Never watched the movie, but from what I've seen, it might as well be my favorite one.<br/>
            I probably don't want to watch it because I don't want to ruin the emotional emprint <br/>
            that movie has on me (based on shorts on Instagram)
